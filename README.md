# The Conductor

The Conductor is a mod about improving the experience of making music in Minecraft.

## The Sequencer
The Sequencer is a block that can control up to three note blocks (four if you're willing to stand on one to program it).

You can use the standard note pitches in Minecraft to program two bars of music per pattern, and there are 8 patterns to select and individually program.

The sequencer can also control the tempo of the music from 60 to 200 beats per minute.

Lastly, you can copy your settings onto a punch card and load it again to either copy the sequence to a new machine, or to save the song for later.
